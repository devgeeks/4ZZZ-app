# 4ZZZfm Mobile App

It's time to finally update this poor ancient app.

I think it's very much in the spirit of community radio for the app to be open source, so this time it is.

```
npm install
```

Then, to run the hot module reloading server:

```
npm start
```

To view in a browser, use `http://localhost:8080`

To run on a simulator, etc:

```
npm run ios
```

or

```
npm run android
```
